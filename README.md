# 2020 NFL QB Draft Class Analysis
### Goal
The goal of this project is to statistically analyze the hotly debated 2020 NFL QB Draft Class frontliners Tua Tagovailoa, Joe Burrow, and Justin Herbert. 
These Quarterbacks will not be analyzed via archaic metrics like passing yards, touchdowns, and interceptions, but rather by using statistical and machine learning methods 
to measure their performance *against expectation*. 
The data from this project has been pulled from the nflfastR database which contains nfl play by play data dating back to 1999. All coding has been done in R. 
I built this project because I wanted to analyze a debate I am very interested in that holds so much nuance and is hard to have an objectively correct answer. 
It's near impossible to find an actual answer to "who's a better Quarterback", but I hope my analysis can help with that.
